# Driebit Thingy

This repo is a simple little site that uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It request a JSON file through a HTTP request and uses the (dummy) data from that JSON file to create these three webpages. It has three Javascript bundles built by webpack in the dist folder. To edit src js files and watch, simply run "yarn run build".

## Instructions

- Download/clone repo. 
- Go to src folder
- Open index.html in your browser
- That should do it!
